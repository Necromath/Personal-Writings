Hey Mauricio.

We're using Tmux now. It's terminal window splitter. It
helps us to write some more code.
This is because with the window splits. We can have multiple
things happening on the terminal at once. I.e. we can have
things that we're writing in vim and we can have the
terminal to execute some other moves. Here are the moves in
tmux that are essential to know.

- `ctrl+b` then `"` to split the window horizontally

- `ctrl+b` then `%` to split the window vertically

- `ctrl+b` then `arrow key` to move between windows

- `ctrl+b` then `x` to close a window

- `ctrl+b` then `c` to create a new window

- `ctrl+b` then `0` to move to window 0

- `ctrl+b` then `1` to move to window 1

- `ctrl+b` then `2` to move to window 2

- `ctrl+b` then `3` to move to window 3

Hi again Mauricio. We are also now using Tabularize. A pretty powerful text aligner
that helps us to align our code. Here are the moves that we use in Tabularize.

- `:Tabularize /` to align by `/` Select the text in visual mode, then type `:Tabularize /` and the symbol we wish to align 
after is written after the '/'

- `:Tabularize /r0c0l0` to align by `/` and right align the first column

- `:Tabularize /l1c1l0` to align by `/` and left align the second column

- `:Tabularize /l1c1l0` to align by `/` and left align the second column

- `:Tabularize /l1c1l0` to align by `/` and left align the second column
